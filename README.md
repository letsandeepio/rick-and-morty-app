# Rick & Morty

Ricky & Morty App is a fun app built-in pure React and enables fans to search through interesting characters that appeared in the famous TV show, Rick & Morty. Fans can view character cards with the photos of the characters, and their status if they are alive or dead, and last known location in the fictitious universe. By default, app shows the top 100 characters from the series. However, curios & ardent fans can enable a cheat code (see below) to view all of the 591 (at last count) characters.
